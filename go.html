    <p hidden> Have you ever gone to a second-hand store and
    they have a big box of old photos from who knows where and
    who knows who took them? It's the strangest experience to go
    through them for hours. You start to recognize these people
    you've never known, see snippet of their lives. After a while
    you'll get a headache. Whether that's from the concentration
    or meeting all these new people, either way you feel groggy.</p>
