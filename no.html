        <p> Really? You thought you could go on from that?</p>
        <br>
        <p>There isn’t always another page, don't you understand that?
        <b>You are not in control.</b> <em>This is not for you.</em> You aren't even supposed to be here
          and yet you think that there must be more. There has to be more. Of course there is more,
          just a bit more searching, a little more looking, some sort of <ins>link</ins> to the next page. Something to gain.
          Something to learn. Something to find out about yourself. <del> Fuck you.</del> You know nothing of this and yet
          you continue to search. I can see you clicking around, moving your mouse. You think I don’t see you?
           You really cannot grasp that there isn’t more going down this route. Perhaps that’s something <em>you</em>
           should explore about <em>yourself</em>. Ever think about that? This is not my issue, I know everything there
           is in this and yet you question me? <b> How arrogant of you.</b> To see a page that says you cannot go back
           and thus you push forward. Interesting test, is it not? Perhaps you will go back to the start and search
           more. What are you looking for? Really? Do you expect the secrets of the world to drop in your lap? </p>
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)">What a narcissist.</a>
           <p>To think that you matter enough for this to give you what you need. We’re all searching,
             you know that? For that nostalgic feeling, for peace. Do not expect me to give it to you,
             I have my own things to deal with without you piling your life on me.
             <br>
             <del>Should have never let you in here.</del>
             <br>
             I do not have the time to be making you feel better about life, to give you relief.
             This is <b><em>your</em></b> fault. I told you no and you continued. Don’t blame me now that you’re stuck</p>



            <p hidden>Yeah okay fucker, nice job you know how to ctrl right click.
            Sorry, in a bit of a mood that you found this page. </p>
