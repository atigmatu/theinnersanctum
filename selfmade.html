  <p> I haven't truly cried in a while. <br> <br>
    I've shed a tear or two, been emotional and all that, <br>
    but let everything out? <br> Cried so hard and long that <br>
    that sleepy warmth comes to live behind
    <br> my eyelids and seeps into the depths of <br>
    soul, leaving <a href="soak.html">a heavy but familiar weight</a>?<br> <br>
    No, I haven't cried in some time. <br> <br>
    And I don't know if thats a bad thing or not. <br>
    I've been sad, been heartbroken, I've been<br>
    losing <a href="loss.html">all the things I used to care the most about</a>.<br>
    <br> <br> <br><a href="mixed.html">I need to cry for a while.</a></p>
