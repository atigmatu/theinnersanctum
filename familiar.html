<p> phone calls with loved ones

  ivy covered buildings

  making someone blush for the first time

  silence of night

  their favorite shirt

  memorizing their phone number

  the color yellow

throat laughs

orange of city lights

leaving flowers on doorsteps

broken in shoes

coming home after a road trip

smelling like bonfire

out of tune "happy birthday"

dancing in the rain
