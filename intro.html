          <p>Welcome to <b>the inner sanctum</b>!
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a website/experience based on healing
            <br>
          trauma and the prepetual
          human condition known
          <br>
          as remembering that you are a person.
          <br>
          (as pretentious as that sounds)
            <br>
            Keeping that in mind, there may be a few instances
            <br>
            in which you become overwhelmed.
            <br>
            <br>
            This experience is not meant to
            frighten, it is
            <br>
          a dive  into the struggle I have and you may
          also;
          <br>
           to <b>stay present and continually grow.</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            If the time comes in which you feel overwhelmed,
            <br>
            I urge you to simply close out, no
            progress can be
            <br>
            made when things feel like
            they are too much,
            <br>
            and I'm not going anywhere,
            <br>

        <p>There will be moments in which the way forward
          (or back) may seem impossible, take a deep breath,
          evaluate where you are and explore.
          <br>
          <b> You're never as lost as you think you are </b>
