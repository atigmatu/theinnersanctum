    <p>I have an old video of an ex playing acoustic while I'm<br>
      laying on my back staring into the clouds. <br> <br>
      I can't quite remember why we were at a soccer field or <br> who else was with us,
      but I <a href="essence.html">don't think that quite matters anymore.</a> <br> Don't even remember what
      he was playing, <br> just the clouds and the cold grass. <br> <br>

      We really weren't good for each other but <a href="alone.html">moments like <br>
      that made me wish that we were.</a>
