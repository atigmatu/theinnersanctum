<p>Have you ever gone to a second-hand store and <br>

  <p>It's the strangest experience to go through them, <br>
  You start to recognize these people you've <br> never known and never will know;<br>

  <p> After a while you'll get a headache. <br>

   or meeting all these new people, <br>
   either way you'll feel groggy.

   I sometimes wonder <a href="found.html">what I would do if I found myself</a> <br>
   in between grandma's 90th birthday and <br>
   a winning baseball game. <br> <br>
   Would I fit? <br>
