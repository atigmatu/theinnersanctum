          <p>Welcome to <b>the inner sanctum</b>!
            <br>
            <br>
            This is a website/experience based on healing
            <br>
          trauma and the prepetual
          human condition known
          <br>
          as remembering that you are a person.
          <br>
          (as pretentious as that sounds)
          <br>
          <br>
          This experience is meant to be a dive
          <br>
        into the struggle I have and you may
        also;
        <br>
         to <b>stay present and continually grow.</b>
          <br>
          <br>
            The website is best experienced full screen with showing tool bar and
            bookmarks as to have the pages format correctly
            <br>
            <br>
             No
            progress can be
            <br>
            made when things feel like
            they are too much,
            <br>
            and I'm not going anywhere,
            <br>
          <b>  I promise.</b>

        <p>There will be moments in which the way forward
          (or back) may seem impossible, take a deep breath,
          evaluate where you are and explore.
          <br>
          <b> You're never as lost as you think you are </b>
